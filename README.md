# Hello World App

A programming console and course application. (WIP)

## Installation

### Using Bun (Recommended)
```bash
bun install
```

## Development

To serve the project in development mode:

```bash
bun serve-src
```

This serves the source files directly from the `src/` directory on `http://localhost:3000`. The HTML file will load the original JavaScript files from `src/scripts/`.

## Build

### Using Build Script
```bash
bun build-dist
```

## Run

After building, serve the application:

```bash
bun serve-dist
```

Then open your browser to the provided URL (typically `http://localhost:8000`).
